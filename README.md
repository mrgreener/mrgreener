<p>Loyalty program for green initiatives</p>

### What is It

MrGreener aims to encourage people to buy more environmentally friendly goods and commit actions to improve the ecological situation.

Our project helps different companies to cooperate. Some companies are willing to give some benefits to people who care about the environment. However, there are a lot of unknown organizations which are trying to save our planet.
Our team would like to help people find such organizations and contribute to sustainability. In addition, MrGreener motivates people via virtual currency -- "Green Points" plus a profile page that people can share on social media.

### How does it work
Organizations can add promotions such as "Get 100 points for every 20 euros on the bill" or "Get 5 points for every recycled bottle". Other organizations can add rewards such as "Get 10 euro gift card for 100 points". After contributing enough, the user can redeem accumulated points and receive benefits.
We believe that organizations will be pleased to participate in our project because such motivation will involve many more people in fighting against environmental problems.
